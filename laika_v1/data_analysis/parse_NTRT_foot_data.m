% Call csvread:

whole_body_rot = data(:, position_X_column + 3 : position_X_column + 5);

% calculate the (initial) global positions of each of the four feet.
% These will be, for example,
% (hip position) + (trans to leg attach) + (trans to foot) + (global

% make them columns

% In addition, NTRT's "zero" is really at some higher distance, AND,
% the center of the sphere is not the point that contacts the bottom.
% It seems as if the "zero height" of the feet, or the "touching the
% ground" of the feet, is at
feet_initial_Z = foot_A_global(2);
% ...we can subtract this back in later.

% Important: get the (approx?) global initial center of mass of each 
% compound rigid (the shoulders, and the hips). This is because
% Bullet doesn't let us specify a local frame, and instead
% stores the whole body's COM. This is why we need the robot to be 
% "close to" the ground when the simulation begins.
% column vector.
shoulders_global_COM = whole_body_pos(1,:)';
% We have to be careful here: the position_x_column needs to be for
% shoulders. Also specify another for the hips!!

% We can now find the local vector between the rigid body's COM and
% the feet.
A_from_COM = foot_A_global - shoulders_global_COM;

% OK, so... we should now be able to calculate the foot positions 
% by the following:
% (1) rotate the local vector according to the rotation matrix of the rigid
% body at that timestep
% (2) add the global COM back in

% Store the positions.
% Do this more intelligently, as column vectors.
