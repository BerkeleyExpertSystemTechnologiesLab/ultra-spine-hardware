% Call csvread:
% Data starts at the third row (row two.)
data = csvread( logfile_name, 2, 0);
% this should give us a whole matrix.

% Pick out the position vectors:
whole_body_pos = data(:, position_X_column : position_X_column + 2);
% and rotations:
whole_body_rot = data(:, position_X_column + 3 : position_X_column + 5);

% calculate the (initial) global positions of each of the four feet.
% These will be, for example,
% (hip position) + (trans to leg attach) + (trans to foot) + (global
% offset)
% make them columns
foot_C_global = (hips_global + leg_C_local + sphere_local + global_offset)';

% Plot the four positions to see if this makes sense.
feet_global = [foot_A_global, foot_B_global, foot_C_global, foot_D_global];

% Important: get the (approx?) global initial center of mass of each 
% compound rigid (the shoulders, and the hips). This is because
% Bullet doesn't let us specify a local frame, and instead
% stores the whole body's COM. This is why we need the robot to be 
% "close to" the ground when the simulation begins.
% column vector.
shoulders_global_COM = whole_body_pos(1,:)';
% We have to be careful here: the position_x_column needs to be for
% shoulders. Also specify another for the hips!!

% We can now find the local vector between the rigid body's COM and
% the feet.
A_from_COM = foot_A_global - shoulders_global_COM;

% OK, so... we should now be able to calculate the foot positions 
% by the following:
% (1) rotate the local vector according to the rotation matrix of the rigid
% body at that timestep
% (2) add the global COM back in

% At each timestep:
for i = 1: size(whole_body_pos, 1)
    % Form the rotation matrix
    t = whole_body_rot(i, 1);
    g = whole_body_rot(i, 2);
