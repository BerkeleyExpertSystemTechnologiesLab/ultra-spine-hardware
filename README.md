# ultra-spine-hardware
Hardware code for the Underactuated Lightweight Tensegrity Robotic Assistive Spine (ULTRA Spine.) This repository is for the embedded systems software for the physical robot.

Code is organized in the following folders:

- ultra-spine-rp: Embedded software for the rapid-prototype version of ULTRA Spine.
At the moment, this is written in Arduino C.

- full-spine-v0_1: Code in Julia for the two-link, fully-actuated prototoype of the Flemons model of a tensegrity spine, controlled with servo motors and a Raspberry Pi.
