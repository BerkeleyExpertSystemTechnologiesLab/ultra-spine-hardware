# ultra-spine-hardware
Hardware code for the Underactuated Lightweight Tensegrity Robotic Assistive Spine (ULTRA Spine.) This repository is for the embedded systems software for the physical robot.

Please see the spine_v1 branch for the code from 2014-2015, for simple Arduino control of the motors.
See the spherical-tensegrity library for the motor wireless communication and motor PID control via Arduino/Teensy.

As of 2018-01-27, this repository contains:
	- laika_v1: code for the arduino-based Laika control, focusing on combinations of lifting specific legs.
