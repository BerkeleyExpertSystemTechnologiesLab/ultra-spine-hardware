# ultra-spine-hardware
Hardware code for the Underactuated Lightweight Tensegrity Robotic Assistive Spine (ULTRA Spine) and Laika, the quadruped robot designed with that spine as its body.
This repository is for the embedded systems software for the physical robot.

Please see the spine_v1 branch for the code from 2014-2015, for simple Arduino control of the motors.
See the spherical-tensegrity library for the motor wireless communication and motor PID control via Arduino/Teensy.

As of 2018-01-27, this repository contains:
	- laika_v1: code for the arduino-based Laika control, focusing on combinations of lifting specific legs.
	- laika_v1_CAD: Solidworks files for the v1 of Laika, as submitted to IROS 2018.
